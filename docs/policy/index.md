# Policy
Policies are objects that define how some value changes through time.
Good example of them is Learning Rate Schedulers.  

## Learning Rate Schedulers
Contrary to default PyTorch Learning Rate schedulers, ours does not require an
optimizer to be passed during initialization.

See [Learning Rate Schedulers docs](./lr_schedulers.md)
